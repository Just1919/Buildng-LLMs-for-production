- Deploy LLMs using scalable architectures
- Monitor performance, latency, and model drift

## 🧠 Topics Covered
- Data preprocessing and prompt engineering
- Fine-tuning and inference optimization
- Model serving and APIs
- Deployment strategies (local, cloud, containers)
- Monitoring, logging, and evaluation
- Responsible and efficient LLM usage

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- PyTorch / Hugging Face
- Transformers
- Docker
- APIs & deployment tools
